# practice-advanced-sql-exercise-noah-b  

(I renamed the repo because we already used the suggested repo name in another practice exercise.)  

** What did you learn from this exercise? **  
I learned practical use cases for SQL methods such as WHERE, HAVING, INNER JOIN, and LEFT JOIN. I also learned the difference between scalar, column, and table subqueries.  

** What was the most challenging? **  
I think that the most challenging concept to understand was table subqueries. It seems like we output a fair amount of code to essentially produce what could have been done with less. I'm guessing that could be some very useful applications for table subqueries, but they may be outside the scope of this lesson.  
The difference between WHERE and HAVING was also difficult to understand, because it requires that you really understand what each line of code is doing, and in what order.
